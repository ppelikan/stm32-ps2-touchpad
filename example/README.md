* Touchpad is connected to the 3v3 board power supply,
* Touchpad's PS/2 Data line -> PB15 (D11 on the board),
* Touchpad's PS/2 Clock line -> PA12 (D13 on the board),
* SSD1306 OLED is connected to the 3v3 board power supply,
* SSD1306 OLED's I2C SCL -> PB8 (D15 on the board),
* SSD1306 OLED's I2C SDA -> PB9 (D14 on the board).

Touchpad used in the example is Synaptics 920-001014-01 RevA.
